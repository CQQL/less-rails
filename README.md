# The dynamic stylesheet language for the Rails asset pipeline.

This gem provides integration for Rails projects using the Less stylesheet language in the asset pipeline.


## Installing

Until we can publish this gem under an official less-rails name, please bundle to the git repo.

    gem 'less-rails', :git => 'git://github.com/metaskills/less-rails.git'


## Configuration

This gem was made for other gems to properly hook into one place to provide paths to the Less::Parser. For example, the less-rails-bootstrap project at http://github.com/metaskills/less-rails-bootstrap
